## Used Microsoft SQL server to store user-generated data, e.g. stay information and booking history, and utilized Google Cloud Storage to store media files for the uploaded stays

## Implemented token-based server side user authentication based on JWT

## Deployed the backend service to Microsoft Azure for better scalability and reliability
